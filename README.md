Simple Calculator (Python Tkinter)

A simple graphical calculator built with Python and Tkinter. This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as user input handling, basic arithmetic operations, GUI development, and error handling.

Features

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Clean and responsive Tkinter interface
* Clear (AC) button to reset calculations
* Percentage and square root operations
* Positive/negative number toggle
* Graceful handling of invalid input and division by zero

Requirements Fulfilled

* Supports the four primary arithmetic operations
* Accepts user input through interactive buttons
* Allows users to select operations directly from the interface
* Handles division by zero using error messages
* Uses structured logic to manage calculator behavior

Built With

* Python 3
* Tkinter

Getting Started

Prerequisites

* Python 3 is installed on your system

Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the application using VS Code and the extension code runner

How It Works

* Users enter values using on-screen buttons.
* An arithmetic operator is selected.
* Pressing `=` evaluates the expression and displays the result.
* Errors such as division by zero are caught and displayed instead of crashing the application.

Learning Outcomes

* Practical experience with Python GUI development
* Improved understanding of event handling in Tkinter
* Basic error handling using try-except blocks
* Writing readable and maintainable Python code

Future Enhancements

* Separate functions for each arithmetic operation
* Keyboard input support
* More descriptive error messages
* Additional scientific calculator features
